- **An adverb modifies or describes a verb, an adjective, or another adverb.**

_gently... extremely... carefully... well_

An adverb describes or modifies a verb, an adjective, or another adverb, but never a noun. It usually answers the questions of when, where, how, why, under what conditions, or to what degree. Adverbs often end in -ly.
