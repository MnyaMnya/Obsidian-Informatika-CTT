- **A noun is the name of a person, place, thing, or idea.**

_man... Butte College... house... happiness_

A noun is a word for a person, place, thing, or idea. Nouns are often used with an article (_the_, _a_, _an_), but not always. Proper nouns always start with a capital letter; common nouns do not. Nouns can be singular or plural, concrete or abstract. Nouns show possession by adding _'s_. Nouns can function in different roles within a sentence; for example, a noun can be a subject, direct object, indirect object, subject complement, or object of a preposition.
