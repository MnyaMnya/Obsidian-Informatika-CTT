**Simplified Instructional Computer (SIC)** is a hypothetical computer that has hardware features that are often found in real machines. There are two versions of this machine: 

1. SIC standard Model
2. SIC/XE(extra equipment or expensive)

Object programs for SIC can be properly executed on SIC/XE which is known as upward compatibility. 

**SIC Machine Architecture/Components –** 

**1. Memory –** 

- Memory is byte-addressable that is words are addressed by the location of their lowest-numbered byte.
- There are 2^15 bytes in computer memory (1 byte = 8 bits)   
    3 consecutive byte = 1 word (24 bits = 1 word)

**2. Registers –** 

There are 5 registers in SIC. Every register has an address associated with it known as a registration number. The size of each register is 3 bytes. On basis of register size, integer size is dependent.   
I. A(Accumulator-0): It is used for mathematical operations.   
II. X(Index Register-1): It is used for addressing.   
III. L(Linkage Register-2): It stores the return address of the instruction in case of subroutines.   
IV. PC(Program Counter-8): It holds the address of the next instruction to be executed.   
V. SW(Status Word-9): It contains a variety of information 

Status Word Register:

- **mode** bit refers to user mode(value=0) or supervising mode(value=1). It occupies 1 bit.[0]
- **state** bit refers whether process is in running state(value=0) or idle state(value=1). It also occupies 1 bit.[1]
- **id** bit refers to process id(PID). It occupies 3 bits.[2-5]
- **CC** bit refers to condition code i.e. It tells whether the device is ready or not. It occupies 2 bits.[6-7]   
    **Mask** bit refers to interrupt mask. It occupies 4 bits.[8-11]
- **X** refers to unused bit. It also occupies 4 bits.[12-15]
- **ICode** refers to interrupt code i.e. Interrupt Service Routine. It occupies the remaining bits.[16-23]

**3. Data Format –** 

- Integers are represented by 24 bits.
- Negative numbers are represented in 2’s complement.
- Characters are represented by 8 bit ASCII values.
- No floating-point representation is available.

**4. Instruction Format –**   
All instructions in SIC have a 24-bit format.

- If x=0 it means direct addressing mode.
- If x=1 it means indexed addressing mode.

**5. Instruction Set –** 

- Load And Store Instructions: To move or store data from accumulator to memory or vice-versa. For example LDA, STA, LDX, STX, etc.
- Comparison Instructions: Used to compare data in memory by contents in accumulator. For example COMP data.
- Arithmetic Instructions: Used to perform operations on accumulator and memory and store results in the accumulator. For example ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV, etc.
- Conditional Jump: compare the contents of accumulator and memory and performs task based on conditions. For example JLT, JEQ, JGT
- Subroutine Linkage: Instructions related to subroutines. For example JSUB, RSUB

**6. Input and Output –**   
It is performed by transferring 1 byte at a time from or to the rightmost 8 bits of the accumulator. Each device has an 8-bit unique code.   
There are 3 I/O instructions: 

- Test Device (TD) tests whether the device is ready or not. Condition code in Status Word Register is used for this purpose. If cc is < then the device is ready otherwise the device is busy.
- Read data(RD) reads a byte from the device and stores it in register A.
- Write data(WD) writes a byte from register A to the device.

###  Here are some applications of SIC:

1. **Computer Architecture education:** The SIC is an excellent tool for teaching computer architecture and organization, as it provides a simplified model of a computer system. By studying the SIC’s architecture, students can learn about the basic components of a computer system, such as the CPU, memory, and I/O devices.
2. **Assembly language programming education:** The SIC’s instruction set is simple and easy to understand, making it a useful tool for teaching assembly language programming. Students can write and execute assembly language programs on the SIC, learning about the various instructions, addressing modes, and program flow control.
3. **Compiler development:** The SIC can be used as a platform for developing compilers for high-level programming languages. Compiler developers can use the SIC’s instruction set and memory organization as a reference for generating assembly language code from high-level code.
4. **Operating system development:** The SIC’s simple architecture can be used as a basis for teaching operating system development. Students can learn about the basic features of an operating system, such as process management, memory management, and I/O management, by implementing them on the SIC.
5. **Emulation and simulation:** The SIC can be used for emulation and simulation purposes, allowing software developers to test their programs on a simulated computer system before deploying them on real hardware.
