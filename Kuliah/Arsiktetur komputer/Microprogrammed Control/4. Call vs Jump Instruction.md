**CALL** instruction is used to call a subroutine. Subroutines are often used to perform tasks that need to be performed frequently. The **JMP** instruction is used to cause the PLC (Programmable Logic Control) to skip over rungs.

The differences Between **CALL** and **JUMP** instructions are:

|SERIAL NO.|JUMP|CALL|
|---|---|---|
|1.|Program control is transferred to a memory location which is in the main program|Program Control is transferred to a memory location which is not a part of main program|
|2.|Immediate Addressing Mode|Immediate Addressing Mode + Register Indirect Addressing Mode|
|3.|Initialisation of SP(Stack Pointer) is not mandatory|Initialisation of SP(Stack Pointer) is mandatory|
|4.|Value of Program Counter(PC) is not transferred to stack|Value of Program Counter(PC) is transferred to stack|
|5.|After JUMP, there is no return instruction|After CALL, there is a return instruction|
|6.|Value of SP does not changes|Value of SP is decremented by 2|
|7.|10 T states are required to execute this instruction|18 T states are required to execute this instruction|
|8.|3 Machine cycles are required to execute this instruction|5 Machine cycles are required to execute this instruction|
