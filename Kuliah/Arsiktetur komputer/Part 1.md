How does data processed in computer

BUS System

- Address
- Data
- Control (instruction eg. Write/read)

CPU structure
- control unit
  - Control the operation of the cpu
- arithmetic and logic unit
  - perform the processing
- register
 - provide internal storage to the cpu
- CPU interconnection
 - mechanism that provide communication among all other structure
