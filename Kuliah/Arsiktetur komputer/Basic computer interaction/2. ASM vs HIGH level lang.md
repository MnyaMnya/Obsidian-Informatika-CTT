# Difference between assembly language and high level language

**1. Assembly level language :**  
It is a low-level language that allows users to write a program using alphanumeric mnemonic codes, instead of numeric code for a set of instructions examples of large assembly language programs from this time are IBM PC DOS.

**2. High-level language :**  
It is a machine-independent language. It enables a user to write a program in a language that resembles English words and familiar mathematical symbols, COBOL was the first high-level language. Examples of high-level language are python,c#, etc.

| - It needs an assembler for conversion                                     | - It needs a compiler/interpreter for conversion                                                 |
| - In this, we convert an Assembly level language to machine level language | - In this, we convert a high-level language to Assembly level language to machine level language |
| - It is machine dependent                                                  | - It is machine-independent                                                                      |

| - It supports low-level operation                                          | - It does not support low-level language                                                         |
| - In this, it is easy to access hardware component                         | - In this, it is difficult to access hardware component                                          |
| - In this more compact code                                                | - No compactness                                                                                 |
