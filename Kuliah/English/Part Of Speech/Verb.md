- **A verb expresses action or being.**

_jump... is... write... become_

The verb in a sentence expresses action or being. There is a main verb and sometimes one or more helping verbs. ("_She can sing."_ _Sing_ is the main verb; _can_ is the helping verb.) A verb must agree with its subject in number (both are singular or both are plural). Verbs also take different forms to express tense.

_The young girl **brought** me a very long letter from the teacher, and then she quickly **disappeared**. Oh my!_
