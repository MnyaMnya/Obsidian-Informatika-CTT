Comparison operators are used to compare two values (or variables). This is important in programming, because it helps us to find answers and make decisions.

The return value of a comparison is either `true` or `false`. These values are known as _Boolean values_, and you will learn more about them in the [[Booleans]] and [[If..Else]]

In the following example, we use the **greater than** operator (`>`) to find out if 5 is greater than 3:

### Example

```java
int x = 5;
int y = 3;
System.out.println(x > y); // returns true, because 5 is higher than 3
```

|Operator|Name|Example|
|---|---|---|
|\=\=|Equal to|x == y|
|!=|Not equal|x != y|
|>|Greater than|x > y|
|<|Less than|x < y|
|>=|Greater than or equal to|x >= y|
|<=|Less than or equal to|x <= y
