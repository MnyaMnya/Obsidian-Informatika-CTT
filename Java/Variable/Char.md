## Characters

The `char` data type is used to store a **single** character. The character must be surrounded by single quotes, like 'A' or 'c':

```java
char myGrade = 'B';
System.out.println(myGrade);
```

Alternatively, if you are familiar with [[ASCII]] values, you can use those to display certain characters:

### Example

```java
char myVar1 = 65, myVar2 = 66, myVar3 = 67;
System.out.println(myVar1);
System.out.println(myVar2);
System.out.println(myVar3);
```
