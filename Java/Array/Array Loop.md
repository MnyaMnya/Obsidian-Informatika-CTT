## Loop Through an Array

You can loop through the array elements with the `for` loop, and use the `length` property to specify how many times the loop should run.

The following example outputs all elements in the **cars** array:

### Example

```java
String[] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};
for (int i = 0; i < cars.length; i++) {
  System.out.println(cars[i]);
}
```

## Loop Through an Array with For-Each

There is also a "**for-each**" loop, which is used exclusively to loop through elements in arrays:

### Syntax

```java
for (type variable : arrayname) {
  ...
}
```

The following example outputs all elements in the **cars** array, using a "**for-each**" loop:

### Example

```java
String[] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};
for (String i : cars) {
  System.out.println(i);
}
```

The example above can be read like this: **for each** `String` element (called **i** - as in **i**ndex) in **cars**, print out the value of **i**.

If you compare the `for` loop and **for-each** loop, you will see that the **for-each** method is easier to write, it does not require a counter (using the length property), and it is more readable.
