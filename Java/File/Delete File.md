To delete a file in Java, use the `delete()` method:

### Example

```java
import java.io.File;  // Import the File class

public class DeleteFile {
  public static void main(String[] args) { 
    File myObj = new File("filename.txt"); 
    if (myObj.delete()) { 
      System.out.println("Deleted the file: " + myObj.getName());
    } else {
      System.out.println("Failed to delete the file.");
    } 
  } 
}
```

The output will be:

`Deleted the file: filename.txt`

## Delete a Folder

You can also delete a folder. However, it must be empty:

### Example

```java
import java.io.File; 

public class DeleteFolder {
  public static void main(String[] args) { 
    File myObj = new File("C:\\Users\\MyName\\Test"); 
    if (myObj.delete()) { 
      System.out.println("Deleted the folder: " + myObj.getName());
    } else {
      System.out.println("Failed to delete the folder.");
    } 
  } 
```

The output will be:

`Deleted the folder: Test`
