## Tables

To add a table, use three or more hyphens (`---`) to create each columnâ€™s header, and use pipes (`|`) to separate each column. For compatibility, you should also add a pipe on either end of the row.

```
| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |
```

The rendered output looks like this:

|Syntax|Description|
|---|---|
|Header|Title|
|Paragraph|Text|

Cell widths can vary, as shown below. The rendered output will look the same.

```
| Syntax | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| Header | Title |
| Paragraph | Text |
```
