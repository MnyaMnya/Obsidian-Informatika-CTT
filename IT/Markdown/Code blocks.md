To create code blocks, indent every line of the block by at least four spaces or one tab.

```
    <html>
      <head>
      </head>
    </html>
```

The rendered output looks like this:

```
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
</html>
```

**Note:** To create code blocks without indenting lines, use [fenced code blocks](Fenced%20Code%20blocks.md Code blocks>).
