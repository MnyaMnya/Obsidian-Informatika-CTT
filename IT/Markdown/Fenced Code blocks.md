The basic Markdown syntax allows you to create [code blocks](<Code blocks.md>) by indenting lines by four spaces or one tab. If you find that inconvenient, try using fenced code blocks. Depending on your Markdown processor or editor, you’ll use three backticks (` ``` `) or three tildes (`~~~`) on the lines before and after the code block. The best part? You don’t have to indent any lines!

````
```
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "age": 25
}
```
````

The rendered output looks like this:

```
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "age": 25
}
```

**Tip:** Need to display backticks inside a code block? See [this section](Escaping%20backtick.md backtick>) to learn how to escape them.
