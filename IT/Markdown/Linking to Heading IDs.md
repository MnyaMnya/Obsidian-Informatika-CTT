### Linking to Heading IDs[](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#linking-to-heading-ids)

You can link to headings with custom IDs in the file by creating a [standard link](Links) with a number sign (`#`) followed by the custom heading ID. These are commonly referred to as _anchor links_.

|Markdown|HTML|Rendered Output|
|---|---|---|
|`[Heading IDs](#heading-ids)`|`<a href="#heading-ids">Heading IDs</a>`|[Heading IDs](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#heading-ids)|

Other websites can link to the heading by adding the custom heading ID to the full URL of the webpage (e.g, `[Heading IDs](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax#heading-ids)`).
